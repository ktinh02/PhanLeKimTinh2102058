# Homework 1: Calculate Probability

This homework focuses on implementing a Python script to calculate the probability of an event occurring based on user input.

## Files Included
- **`hw1.py`**: The main Python script to calculate probability.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of required Python libraries (if any are needed).

---

## Prerequisites
To run the script, you need the following:
1. **Python version**: Python 3.7 or higher.
2. **Required Libraries**: The libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, then run the following commands:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/PhanLeKimTinh2102058.git
     cd PhanLeKimTinh2102058/Homeworks/Hw1
     ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   - Run these commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   *(Note: Currently, no additional libraries are required for this homework, so the `requirements.txt` file may remain empty.)*
